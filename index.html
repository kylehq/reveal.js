				<!-- Notes:

				Crap at code because 18 months ago it was different
				Increase gif sizes, use full area of screen
				Wait for animation finish - then talk to get point accross
				Show examples of how crap my code is
				Show my own failures - eg picture of me on the day "what was I thinking"
				Political jokes/failing
				This sounds great, where do I sign up to start failing - how do I start failing
				Perfect example of failing is to show how I didn't make 50 minutes!

				More examples of people/companies that fail successful

					<h2>The beginning</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							So when I decided to speak here today, I kinda assumed that most of the talks here over the
							2 days would be around technical elements, patterns or practices. But none would be focussing
							on the stuff that really gets us juiced about what we do.
						</p>
						<p>
							In addition, Vend and its dev team, would certainly like to become thought leaders in the PHP/Tech space.
							But word on the is that Vend is a bit of an elite crowd, that our code smells sweeter than most. And I had
							a think about this and thught, that's bullshit. That's not what makes me get outta bed and play.

							Ford’s Inability to Let Go
							Like many innovators, Henry Ford made several blunders throughout his career (such as the Edsel, a clunky car that
							was only in production for two years), but perhaps the most famous mistake Ford made was not taking action,
							rather than acting incorrectly. A few years after the beloved Model T was released, members of his team encouraged Ford to
							innovate its design in order to keep up with competitors.
						</p>
						<p>
							While Ford was on vacation, a member of his team designed a new prototype with low-slung frame, and the sight of the new
							car enraged Ford so much that he destroyed it with his bare hands. As competition grew stiffer, Ford was eventually
							dethroned from its position as the number one American automotive company, and it spent decades struggling to reclaim its place.
